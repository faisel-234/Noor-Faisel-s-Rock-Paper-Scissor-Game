## Rock Paper Scissors Game - Code Review & Redesingned Version
## Project Overview

This project is a reviewed and redesigned version of an MIT-licensed Rock–Paper–Scissors game originally developed by Abdellah.

Rather than treating the project as a simple reuse, I approached it as a technical case study. I first conducted a deep analysis of the existing codebase to understand its overall architecture, logical flow, and implementation strategy. This included studying how game states were managed, how user interactions were handled, and how core game rules were implemented using JavaScript.

After fully understanding the original implementation, I redesigned and customized the project with a strong focus on UI/UX improvements and maintainable front-end structure.


## Architecture & Code Review

- Analyzed the separation of concerns between HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic
- Studied the game logic flow, including user input handling, result calculation, and state updates
- Reviewed DOM manipulation patterns and event-driven interactions
- Identified areas suitable for visual enhancement without altering core logic


## UI & Design Redesign

After completing the architectural and logic review, I implemented a modern UI redesign to improve usability and visual clarity.

Key design changes include:
- Updated color palette for a more modern and consistent look
- Redesigned button components with an oval shape for improved visual hierarchy
- Improved border styling and spacing to enhance layout balance
- Refined visual feedback elements to improve user interaction experience

All design changes were implemented using pure CSS, ensuring responsiveness and clean styling without external libraries.


## Technologies Used

- HTML5 – semantic structure and layout
- CSS3 – modern styling, layout control, and UI redesign
- JavaScript (ES6) – game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation



## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Implementing and modifying game logic using JavaScript
- Reading and refactoring existing codebases
- Separating logic, structure, and styling effectively
- Improving UI/UX without breaking core functionality
- Applying modern design principles to small-scale web applications

## 👤 Full Professional Introduction

Name: Noor Faisel Arkane

I am a self-taught web developer and community leader originally from Myanmar, currently living in a refugee camp in Bangladesh.
I completed my high school education in Bangladesh; however, due to my refugee status, I have not had access to formal higher education or opportunities to study at an international university. Rather than allowing these limitations to define my future, I chose to pursue independent learning through online documentation, open-source projects, free courses, tutorials, and educational playlists.
My learning approach is practical and analytical. I actively study real-world codebases, review project architectures, understand implementation logic, and apply my own modifications and redesigns to strengthen my technical skills. Through this process, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern front-end development practices.
Beyond technology, I am deeply committed to social impact and justice. I am the President of the Society for Peace, Justice, and Humanity, an organization founded by refugee youth within the camp. Our mission is to promote refugee development, human rights awareness, youth empowerment, and protection through education, documentation, and community-led initiatives.
My goal is to work for refugee development and human rights advocacy with the help of modern technologies. I believe that by combining my technical skills with my social impact, I can make a meaningful contribution to the lives of refugees.
